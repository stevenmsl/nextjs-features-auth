- Server side
  - define a catch-all route
    - #TA01
  - pick a provider and configure the authorize method
    - #TA02

- Client side
  - use the signIn method
    - #TA03

- nextAuth will put the token in the cookies once authenticated
  - next-auth.session-token

- once authenticated, use "useSession" to access the session
  - #TA04 
  - seems the "loading" returned by the useSession will not get
    updated properly if you are already authenticated
    - workaround using getSession #TA05
  - getSession also works on the server side
    - #TA06
- use Provider to improve the performance
  - #TA07

- protect regular API routes
  - #TA08
